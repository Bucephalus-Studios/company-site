        <h2>Bucephalus Studios</h2>

        Bucephalus Studios LLC is a sole-proprietor software company founded in 2021 by Jeff Stevens. We are dedicated
        toward making
        interesting, original games that are not plagued by the problems of modern triple-A games like predatory
        economies,
        huge price tags, and bad player-developer relationships. We are inspired by the golden age of SNES RPGs, the
        forgotten flash games
        of Newgrounds, and esoteric hits like Dwarf Fortress to create worlds you can lose yourself in.
        <br />
        We are also a supporter of free open-source software. Check out our software page to see our programs you can
        download
        for free!

        Hi, I'm Jeff Stevens, and this was me as a kid. (show picture of me playing runescape as a kid)

        I'm in my 20s now, and these memories of meeting up with my lunchtable friends in MMORPGs, braving the wild-west
        of early
        internet forums and image boards, and playing every flash game I could find on Newgrounds made me the game
        developer I am today.
        I always had a yearning to bring my imaginations to life through playing make-believe and drawing comics, but I
        felt making games
        would be the coolest way to express myself. So that's what I decided to do!

        Nowadays, I work from home doing business as Bucephalus Studios designing games, writing code, and doing the
        mish-mash of other tasks that comes with pulling a game into the world kicking and screaming. Outside of work
        you'll find me doing olympic
        saber fencing, watching horror movies, or cooking up some tikka masala in my kitchen.
