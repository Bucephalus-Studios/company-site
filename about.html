<h2>Bucephalus Studios</h2>

Bucephalus Studios LLC is a sole-proprietor software company founded in 2021 by Jeff Stevens. We are dedicated toward making
interesting, original games that are not plagued by the problems of modern triple-A games like predatory economies,
huge price tags, and bad player-developer relationships. We are inspired by the golden age of SNES RPGs, the forgotten flash games
of Newgrounds, and esoteric hits like Dwarf Fortress to create worlds you can lose yourself in.
<br/>
We are also a supporter of free open-source software. Check out our software page to see our programs you can download
for free!

Hi, I'm Jeff Stevens, and this was me as a kid. (show picture of me playing runescape as a kid)

I'm in my 20s now, and these memories of meeting up with my lunchtable friends in MMORPGs, braving the wild-west of early
internet forums and image boards, and playing every flash game I could find on Newgrounds made me the game developer I am today.
I always had a yearning to bring my imaginations to life through playing make-believe and drawing comics, but I felt making games
would be the coolest way to express myself. So that's what I decided to do!

Nowadays, I work from home doing business as Bucephalus Studios designing games, writing code, and doing the 
mish-mash of other tasks that comes with pulling a game into the world kicking and screaming. Outside of work you'll find me doing olympic
saber fencing, watching horror movies, or cooking up some tikka masala in my kitchen.
