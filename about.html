            <h2>About Bucephalus Studios</h2>

            Bucephalus Studios LLC is a sole-proprietor software company founded in 2021 by Jeff Stevens. We are dedicated
            toward making interesting, original games that are not plagued by the problems of modern triple-A games like 
            predatory economies, big price tags, and bad player-developer relationships. We are inspired by the quality of
            masterpieces like Chrono Trigger and the insanity of esoteric titles like Liberal Crime Squad, and hope to combine
            these virtues to create games that you can make a core part of your identity :)
            <br />
            <br />
            We are also a supporter of free open-source software. Check out our software page to see our programs you can
            download for free!

            Hi, I'm Jeff Stevens, and this was me as a kid. (show picture of me playing runescape as a kid)
            <img>
            I'm in my 20s now, and these memories of meeting up with my lunchtable friends in MMORPGs, braving the wild-west
            of early internet forums and image boards, and playing every flash game I could find on Newgrounds made me the game
            developer I am today. 
            <br />
            <br />
            I always had a yearning to bring my imaginations to life through playing make-believe and drawing comics, but I
            felt making games would be the coolest way to express myself. So that's what I decided to do!
            <br />
            <br />
            Nowadays, I work from home doing business as Bucephalus Studios designing games, writing code, and doing the
            mish-mash of other tasks that comes with pulling a game into the world kicking and screaming. Outside of work
            you'll find me doing olympic saber fencing, watching horror movies, or cooking up some tikka masala in my kitchen.
